`Session` is a very lightweight wrapper over `URLSession` only focused on the `async` versions of its methods. This library will only focus on the usage of Swift Concurrency and thus, no completion handler based methods are implemented or will ever be.

## Why would I use this?

The main goal of this small wrapper is two fold:

- backwards compatibility of the `URLSession` async methods.
- rapid prototyping of a `URLSession` object, with simple configurations in a SwiftUI DSL fashion.


## Installation

If you're working directly in a Package, add `Session` to your Package.swift file

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/JARMourato/Session.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
]
```

If working in an Xcode project select `File->Add Packages...` and search for the package name: `Session` or the git url:

`https://github.com/JARMourato/Session.git`

## Usage

### Initialization 

Here is how one would create a `Session` object 

```swift
let session = Session()
```

Pretty simple am I right ? ðŸ™ƒ

When nothing is specified, every option follows the defaults used by Apple. So a session created without any parameters uses `URLSessionConfiguration.default`. 


However, one might need to change a configuration or two. So here are the options you could use: 

```swift
let session = Session {
	// Set up caching
	Cache(urlCache: /*Some URLCache*/)
	// Delegates       
	Delegate.session(/*some URLSessionDelegate object*/) 
	Delegate.task(/*some URLSessionTaskDelegate object*/) // Only relevant for iOS 15 and above.
	// Turn off some default behaviors
	Disable.constrainedNetworkAccess
	Disable.expensiveNetworkAccess
	// Turn on additional behavior
	Enable.waitingForConnectivity
	// Add session wide headers         
	Headers(httpHeaders: [:])
	// Set your own URLSessionConfiguration preset
	Preset.background(identifier: "some id", sharedContainerIdentifier: "optional shared container id", isDiscretionary: false /* default is true */)
	Preset.custom(/* Some URLSessionConfiguration object*/) 
	Preset.ephemeral
	// Set a mock or something... 
	ProtocolClasses(classes: [ /* some classes */ ])
	// Override the default timeouts
	Timeout.request(10)
	Timeout.resource(60)
}
```

### Methods

**Given that all methods are `async` you have to run them in an `async` context such as within `Task { /* your code */ }`.**

The library adds a syntax sugar by way of a `Requestable` protocol: 

```swift
public protocol Requestable {
    func buildURLRequest() throws -> URLRequest
}
```

Which means, that any type that conforms to `Requestable` can be used directly in the methods as opposed to being bounded by the usage of a `URLRequest`. Naturally, `URLRequest` conforms to `Requestable` so you still can use that. 

The provided methods are wrappers over the `URLSession` versions, providing backwards compatibility with `async` as well as a couple helper return types. 

### Data

Nothing fancy here

```swift
let response = try await session.data(for: requestable) 
let data: Data = response.data
let urlResponse: URLResponse = response.urlResponse
```

or if you want to get your `Requestable` paired with the response

```swift
let response = try await session.dataResponse(for: requestable) 
let request: some Requestable = response.request
let data: Data = response.result.data
let urlResponse: URLResponse = response.result.urlResponse
```

### Download

```swift
let response = try await session.download(for: requestable) /* or try await session.download(resumeFrom: data)  */
let location: URL = response.url
let urlResponse: URLResponse = response.urlResponse
```

### Upload

```swift
let response = try await session.upload(for: requestable, fromFile: url) /* or try await session.upload(for: requestable, fromData: data)  */
let data: Data = response.data
let urlResponse: URLResponse = response.urlResponse
```
